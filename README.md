# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Model

This project predicts customer churn using the Spotify dataset from Kaggle. 
It uses a Random Forest classifier to determine churn based on engagement metrics such as track duration and popularity.

## Dataset
[Spotify Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ambaliyagati/spotify-dataset-for-playing-around-with-sql)
[Customer Churn Prediction Model](https://www.kaggle.com/code/elsiemicah/customer-churn-prediction-model): Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow.
requirements.txt: Python dependencies for the project.

## Steps

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature engineering
3. Churn definition based on thresholds
4. Model training and evaluation using Random Forest

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of **100%** with insights into feature importance.

## Installation
