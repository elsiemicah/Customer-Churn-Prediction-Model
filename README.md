# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Model

This project predicts customer churn using the Spotify dataset from Kaggle. 
It uses a Random Forest classifier to determine churn based on engagement metrics such as track duration and popularity.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle. It includes attributes like:
- `duration` (track length in seconds)
- `popularity` (Spotify popularity score)
- `genre`, `explicit`, and more.

## Steps

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature engineering
3. Churn definition based on thresholds
4. Model training and evaluation using Random Forest

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of **XX%** with insights into feature importance.
